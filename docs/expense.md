## Functions

1. process_expense_command Function:
This function handles the initial expense-related command from a user.
It sends a message to the user with a keyboard markup that allows them to choose from options: "Add," "Delete," or "Update."
It registers a callback function (expense_option_selection) to handle the user's choice.

2. expense_option_selection Function:
This function is called when the user selects an option from the keyboard markup.
Depending on the selected option ("Add," "Delete," or "Update"), it directs the user to the respective function to perform that action.

3. select_expense_category Function:

It sends a message with a keyboard markup containing expense categories.
It registers a callback function (expense_category_selected) to handle the user's category selection.

This function processes the selected expense category.
It validates the selected category and asks the user for the amount spent in that category.

5. record_expense Function:
This function records the expense with the specified category and amount.
It validates the amount, checks if it's nonzero, and records the expense along with the current date and time.
It then stores the expense in the user's data and sends a confirmation message.
Finally, it calls helper.display_remaining_budget to display the remaining budget information for the category.

It retrieves the user's expense history, generates a keyboard markup with the expenses, and registers a callback to confirm the deletion.
