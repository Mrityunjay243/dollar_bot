## Why should you use Expense Management Bot?

Expense-Management-Bot is an easy-to-use Telegram Bot that assists you in recording your daily expenses on a local system without any hassle.  
With simple commands, this bot allows you to:
- Add/Record new spendings
- Display your spendings through bar graph
- Show the sum of your expenditure for the current day/month
- Display your spending history
- Clear/Erase all your records
- Edit/Change any spending details if you wish to
- Visualize your spending patterns
- Export your spend history to tools like excel and perform an analysis
- If telegram isn't convenient enough, use discord

## Check out the video!

Please refer to this [Video](https://youtu.be/T8yfeBl6-0A) for understanding the working and what's new in the telegram bot!

[This video](https://github.com/Mrityunjay243/dollar_bot/assets/48481966/5d3b8142-9a0a-41f2-bf3d-44db3b1e06b6) can be referred to see the added functionality of discord works.

Rubric for Project 3: [Rubric](https://github.com/Mrityunjay243/dollar_bot/blob/main/Proj3_SelfAssessmentRubric.md)

## Installation

Please follow the instructions given in [this documentation](https://github.com/Mrityunjay243/dollar_bot/wiki/Installations-and-Running-the-Bot) for installations and running the bot.

## Testing

We use pytest to perform testing on all unit tests together. The command needs to be run from the home directory of the project. The command is:
```
python run -m pytest test/
```

## Code Coverage

Code coverage is part of the build. Every time new code is pushed to the repository, the build is run, and along with it, code coverage is computed. This can be viewed by selecting the build, and then choosing the codecov pop-up on hover.

Locally, we use the coverage package in python for code coverage. The commands to check code coverage in python are as follows:

```
coverage run -m pytest test/
coverage report
```

## Future RoadMap

- The bot can be integrated with Slack like it is currently done with discord to make it seamless to use. 
- More content can be added for the way notifications can be displayed on the user front. This can be done to make the UI more interactive.
